# Minecraft Discord Chat

Minecraft Discord Chat is a mod which not only allows bridging Minecraft and Discord chat, but also implements various features of Discord in Minecraft and syncs those. The new features include: emojis (builtin and custom), mentions (of users, both in Discord and Minecraft, and Discord roles), and editing and deleting messages.
